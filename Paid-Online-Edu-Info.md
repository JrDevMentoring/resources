# Paid Online Education Information

The point of this file is to tell you about online learning resources that are not free but have free trials. Read carefully as some of the links below will have descriptions as to how you can either get a free trial if there wasn't one or how to get an extended trial. 

* [Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com)
  * **If you don't already have a Pluralsight account**, all you have to do is sign up for a free "Visual Studio Dev Essentials" account and they'll give you a 3-month trail of Pluralsight instead of the standard 30 day trial.  If you're in a pinch you can always use a new/different email address. This information is correct as of 2/15/17. https://www.visualstudio.com/dev-essentials

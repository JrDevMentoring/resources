# Contributing to the Resources

Before contributing to a resource file or creating a new file please read the following about GitHub Markdown:

* [Mastering Markdown - Github Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Keep in mind we use the following styleguide:

```github
# File Title


## Subject Name
* (Resource Name)[Resource URL]
```

Pick a file that best represents the resource you want to share.

Let's say you wanted to share a link to a tutorial about Unit Testing in Rails.

You'd open up Learn-Back-End-Dev.md, navigate to the Ruby section and post the following:

```github
* (Unit Testing in Rails)[http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html]
```

If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/JrDevMentoring/resources/issues).
